I’ve created a basic project that works on the concept of Applying Machine Learning on DevOps.
We as a developers face problems while installing some softwares but it fails and shoots an error : dependency is not satisfiable. Even to run some application successful we have to downgrade or upgrade some dependencies and we have to keep on changing our environment.
But using the concept of conterization we can create a separate environment where we want to train our machine learning model. We use Docker , With Docker, it’s all just a matter of executing a couple of commands to spin up a container. Docker container can be shipped across platforms , it means the program that runs on Windows development web-server never fails to run on a Linux Production server.
